### What
Here you can find the original vector design files as well as a couple of derivative version of the Drunken Strawberry Emoji. I'm releasing this as under a non-restrictive Creative Commoms Zero License so you're basically free to use it in any way you like. see the included LICENSE file for details.

### Why?
During a dutch late night talkshow in 2020, during a discussion on #covid19 the actor Huub Stapel called out a populist politician as "A drunken strawberry talking bullshit." (liberal translation of "Gelul van een dronken aardbei".) The phrase was coined by dutch comedians Kees van Kooten and Wim de Bie while in character as members of a fictional populist political party, the "Counter Party" (Tegen Partij) back in the late 1970s, early 1980s. This is my contribution to the ongoing debate on Covid19 so it will be more fun to call out people proclaiming nonsense on the pandemic. But you're welcome to use it any way you like. For one I would welcome antivaxers, covid19 deniers, plateathers and the likes to use it in their social media profiles. It will enhance their brand recognition and makes them easier to distinguish from sane people.
